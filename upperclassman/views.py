We are thrilled to have you participating in this initiative. \n\nAfter the survey window has closed on Saturday, September 12, we will share with you the survey responses of new students in your college and major, providing you with the opportunity to handpick a new student based on similar interests. Then, it is your responsibility to email them to arrange a meeting at a public place on campus. We will remind you when the selection process has begun via email.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThanks, \nThe Let\'s Get Coffee Steering Committee'
